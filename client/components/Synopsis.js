            HUMANITY must expand. In our search for new riches, a GATEWAY is uncovered. The first pioneers
            dub a sector NOS ATOMOS as most fruitful and construction of the capital city, KRYPTOS, begins.
            However, humans are not alone in this new frontier. From the shadows lurk the original inhabitants
            of this world -- the CRYPTIDS.

            The idea of this project is the fantastical brain-child of four entrepreneurial siblings who pooled
            their creative talents to create something awesome. They asked themselves: What do we think is cool?
            What do we want to share with the world? What hasnâ€™t been done before?
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We see, and want to harness, the potential NFTs have to connect and empower artists, creators, and visionaries.
